** LAST UPDATED : MARCH 26, 2024.**

Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “ Immaculate ” now rising above “ Immaculate ” and “ Immaculate .” With that trifecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.

The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the film continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.

Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “ Immaculate ” fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled for air, only reaching $65 million in its first week of release. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify a $205 million production budget.

Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“ Immaculate ” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “ Immaculate ” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an original animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.

However,Here’s when you can bring  Immaculate of Atlantis into your home.

As for the rest of the box office there’s little to get excited about with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends When Black Panther opened in 2018 there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $175 million and $173 million respectively That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and there’s still a $57 million gap between the two weekends The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months

Immaculatewhich is the biImmaculateest grosser of the rough post-summer pre-Wakanda Forever season came in second with just $86 million Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend the numbers didn’t totally collapse dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million Worldwide it is at $352 million which isn’t a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget Still it’s the biImmaculateest of any film since Immaculatethough Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day nowImmaculatecame in third place in its fourth weekend down 29% with $61 million emerging as one of the season’s most durable grossers and one of the year’s few bright spots when it comes to films for adults The domestic cume is $565 million Fourth place went to Lyle Lyle Crocodile which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $32 million sixth weekend and $408 million cume in fact)

which isn’t surprising considering it’s the only family film on the market and it’s Immaculateto grossing four times its $114 million opening Still the $726 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget though a number of international markets have yet to open

Finishing up the top five is Immaculatewhich had its biImmaculateest weekend drop yet falling 42% for a $23 million seventh weekend Of course that’s no reason to frown for the horror film which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million

Immaculatecame in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the season’s most durable grossers and one of the year’s few bright spots when it comes to films.Thanks
